TimeStampOBJ use TimeOBJ available on : https://github.com/YannChansigaud/TimeOBJ

TimeStampOBJ is designed to define a time mark. All internal calculation are using microsecond with micros()

WARNING : all values sended to TimeStampOBJ with overloaded comparison operator ( >, <, >=, <= ) are evaluated as millisecond in view to correspond to millis()
          define TimeStampOBJ_defaultFormat to "MICRO" if you want to pass microseconds values

PAY ATTENTION : this class has to be called with compute() at least 1 time per hours
                maximum delay between two calls : 1h 11min 34s 967ms 295us (H/M/S/ms/us equivalent for the maximum of uint32_t length return by micros() )

- This class didn't reset micros().
- micros() rollback to zero by itself when uint32_t maximum reached

This class use 2 TimeOBJ objects
- TimeOBJ now : Time object to store total execution time since the begining 
- TimeOBJ pass : Time object to store elapsed time since last call
                 This object is use to store temporary values used by comparison operator

- TNOW, TPREV, TPASS : uint32_t variables used for calculation with micros()
